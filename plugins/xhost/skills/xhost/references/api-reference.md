# xhostd API Reference

This is the underlying HTTP API that the MCP tools wrap. For normal agent usage, prefer the `mcp__xhost__*` tools — they handle auth automatically via OAuth and do not require any user-facing token step. This reference is here for deep dives, debugging, or direct programmatic access.

Base URL: `https://api.xhostd.com`

All authenticated endpoints require the header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where `<token>` is either the user's OAuth-issued bearer (carried by the MCP server) or a unified credential minted via the `get_credentials` MCP tool (git + Postgres + object storage + downloads + platform API, full default scopes, 30 days). Pass `scopes` and `expires_in` to that tool for a narrower, shorter-lived credential.

All error responses use the envelope: `{"error": {"code": "<code>", "message": "<message>"}}`

> **Signing up** happens in the browser via Google sign-in on first OAuth authorization. There is no signup API.

## GET /apps

List all apps owned by the authenticated user.

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json

  "apps": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "my-app",

- `channels[].pending_deploy` — the channel's newest queued or running deploy, as `{"deploy_id": "uuid", "sha": "...", "status": "queued" | "running"}`, or `null` when nothing is in flight. `current_sha` only advances when a deploy succeeds, so an old `current_sha` next to a non-null `pending_deploy` means the new deploy has not finished yet — it does not mean the deploy failed.

---

## POST /apps

Create a new app. Provisions a git repository and a `prod` channel automatically.

**Required scope:** `repo:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "template": "static"
}
```

- `name` (string, required) — Must be a valid DNS label and must not use a reserved prefix (see Hostname Rules)
- `template` (string, optional, default `"static"`) — Runtime template. Valid values: `"static"` (nginx static file serving), `"app"` (user-provided `install.sh` + `launch.sh`), and `"docker"`. The `app` template runs inside an `xhost-runtime` image with Node 22, Python 3.13, and build tools pre-installed. The user provides `install.sh` (optional, installs dependencies — runs at **build** time as root) and `launch.sh` (required, starts the app on `$XHOST_HTTP_PORT` — runs at boot as the non-root `app` user, whose writable paths are `/app`, `$HOME`, `/tmp`). The `docker` template builds the `Dockerfile` at the repo root on every deploy and runs the image with its own `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`. Both non-`static` templates pass the health check on **either** of two signals, whichever arrives first: listen on `$XHOST_HTTP_PORT` (injected; `$PORT` is still injected at the same value, so existing apps keep working, but it is deprecated and will be removed — use `$XHOST_HTTP_PORT` in new code) and answer `GET /` with a 2xx, **or** create the file named by `$XHOST_READY_FILE` (also injected — a per-deploy path directly under `/tmp`, so no `mkdir` and no shell are needed). The second signal exists so a channel with no HTTP surface — a queue consumer, cron daemon or stream processor — needs no dummy listener; create it once the app is actually running, not at the top of the start command. Such a channel keeps its hostname and route, and that URL returns 502, which is expected. Env vars are injected at run time only — never as build args, so secrets are unavailable during the build and must never be baked into the image. Charged image size (total minus warm-base layers) is capped per plan: basic 512 MiB / builder 2 GiB / indie 4 GiB / pro 12 GiB (the same caps apply to the `app` template). Match every `FROM` to a warm base image — including a build-only stage in a multi-stage build, since every stage that names one starts with no pull: `node:22-slim`, `node:24-slim`, `node:26-slim`, `python:3.11-slim`, `python:3.12-slim`, `python:3.13-slim`, `python:3.14-slim`, `debian:trixie-slim`. The final stage's warm-base layers are also exempt from the charged size. Docker deploys stream `[build] ...` lines (queue position, build duration, image size vs cap) into the deploy log.

**Response (200):**
```json

  "id": "uuid",

```

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid app name, reserved prefix, name already taken, or invalid template
- `bad_request` (400) — could not provision git backend

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}

Get details of a single app by UUID.

**Response (200):** Same shape as a single entry in the `GET /apps` response (an App object with channels).

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app not found or not owned by caller

---

## DELETE /apps/{app_id}

Delete an app and all its channels. Tears down containers, networks, and Caddy routes.

**Required scope:** `repo:*`

**Response:** 204 No Content

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app not found or not owned by caller

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels

List all channels for an app.

**Response (200):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "prod",
    "hostname": "my-app-alice.xhostd.app",
    "git_ref_binding": "branch:master",

    "git_ref_binding": "branch:*",
    "current_sha": null,
    "status": "provisioning",
    "pending_deploy": null
  }
]
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app not found or not owned by caller

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels

Create a new channel on an app.

**Required scope:** `channel:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "name": "wildcard",
  "git_ref_binding": "branch:*"
}
```

- `name` (string, required) — Must be a valid DNS label. Cannot be `prod` (reserved; system-created).
- `git_ref_binding` (string, required) — Must match the pattern `branch:<name>` or `branch:*`. The `<name>` portion must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9/_\-\.]*$`.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "wildcard",
  "hostname": "wildcard-my-app-alice.xhostd.app",
  "git_ref_binding": "branch:*",
  "current_sha": null,
  "status": "provisioning",
  "pending_deploy": null
}
```

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid name, reserved channel name, or invalid `git_ref_binding` format

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}

Get details of a single channel.

**Response (200):** Same shape as a single entry in the `GET /apps/{app_id}/channels` response.

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app or channel not found

---

## DELETE /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}

Delete a channel. Cannot delete the `prod` channel.

**Required scope:** `channel:*`

**Response:** 204 No Content

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app or channel not found
- `bad_request` (400) — cannot delete the prod channel

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/deploy

Manually enqueue a deploy of a specific SHA to a channel.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "sha": "abc1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345"
}
```

- `sha` (string, optional) — A 40-character hex SHA or a branch name matching `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9/_\-\.]*$`
- `ref` (string, optional) — A branch name to resolve and deploy; equivalent to passing a branch name as `sha`.

At least one of `sha` or `ref` must be provided. If both are given, `sha` wins and `ref` is ignored.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "deploy_id": "uuid",
  "channel_id": "uuid",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint must be called explicitly after `git push` to trigger a deploy. Pushing code does not automatically deploy.

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid SHA format, or neither `sha` nor `ref` given
- `not_found` (404) — app or channel not found

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/rewind

Instantly rewind a channel to its previous deploy's image — a one-step cutover with no rebuild, no git sync, and no snapshot (it boots the retained image directly, so it is fast). "Previous" is the last successful deploy whose commit differs from the one live now.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Request body:** none.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "deploy_id": "uuid",
  "channel_id": "uuid",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

**Note:** To go back to an OLDER commit, or to force a fresh rebuild, use the deploy endpoint with an explicit `sha` instead. Rewind is not available for `static` apps (they bind-mount the live worktree and have no built image).

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — the app is `static`, or the channel has only ever deployed one commit (nothing to rewind to)
- `conflict` (409) — the account is mid-move
- `not_found` (404) — app or channel not found

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/logs?deploy={deploy_id}

Fetch one deploy's status and a byte window of its build log.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Query parameters:**
- `deploy` (required) — the deploy UUID.
- `offset` (integer, optional) — byte offset to read the log from. Without it, the reply carries the LAST `max_bytes` bytes of the log, advanced past the first newline so the window starts on a whole line. An explicit `offset` reads byte-exactly from that offset, with no line snapping; an offset past the end of the file yields an empty `log`.
- `max_bytes` (integer, optional, default 16384, max 262144) — window size in bytes.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "deploy_id": "uuid",
  "git_sha": "84c0cf68c769def1234567890abcdef123456789",
  "status": "success",
  "started_at": "2026-08-27T14:09:36Z",
  "finished_at": "2026-08-27T14:10:45Z",
  "log_bytes": 31004,
  "offset": 15020,
  "window_bytes": 15984,
  "log": "[2026-08-27T14:09:36+00:00] deploy begin ...\n"
}
```

- `status` — one of `queued`, `running`, `success`, `failed`. Read the outcome here; never grep the log text for `deploy success`.
- `finished_at` — `null` while the status is `queued` or `running`.
- `log_bytes` — the total size of the log. `offset` is where the returned window starts.
- `window_bytes` — the byte length of the returned window, counted before utf-8 decoding (`len(log)` is not byte-exact when a window boundary splits a multibyte character). The next page starts at `offset + window_bytes`; `offset + window_bytes` equal to `log_bytes` means the reply reaches the end of the log.
- A queued deploy with no log yet answers 200 with an empty `log` and `log_bytes: 0`, not 404.

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — deploy not found under this app and channel

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/runtime/log

The **running** app's stdout/stderr — everything after the deploy window that
the logs endpoint above covers. The log survives a redeploy: when a new
version replaces a container, the replaced container's log is archived, so an
older `container_index` still reads back.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

The log is written to `/log/app.log` inside a throwaway container (cwd `/log`),
and the `command` you send runs there. It is a Debian userland with `sh`,
`bash`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `tail`, `head`, `cut`, `tr`, `sort`, `uniq`,
`wc`, `find`, `xargs`, `python3`, `node` and `perl` — but **no `jq`, `rg` or
`less`**. The container has **no network**, gets 30 s, and its combined
stdout+stderr comes back in `output`, capped at ~256 KiB.

It is a POST, not a GET, so the command never lands in an access log.

**Body:**
- `command` (optional) — the shell pipeline to run, e.g. `"tail -n 200 app.log"` or `"grep -i error app.log | tail -20"`. Max 4096 chars. **Omit it** and no container is started at all: the reply is the status header only.
- `container_index` (optional) — read a specific (usually already-replaced) container; default is the newest.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "container_index": 3,
  "container_id": "9f2c...",
  "container_name": "xhost-1a2b3c4d-5e6f7a8b-00000003",
  "running": false,
  "source": "archive",
  "status": "exited",
  "exit_code": 137,
  "oom_killed": true,
  "restart_count": 2,
  "started_at": "2026-07-24T09:12:00.000000000Z",
  "finished_at": "2026-07-24T09:41:13.000000000Z",
  "available_indices": [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "log_bytes": 41238,
  "output": "2026-07-24T09:41:12.880Z Killed\n",
  "command_exit_code": 0,
  "timed_out": false,
  "truncated": false
}
```

- `source` — `live` (the container still exists) or `archive` (it was removed; this is the saved copy).
- `oom_killed` — true means the app exceeded the plan's memory limit.
- `available_indices` — every container index readable for this channel, live or archived.
- `exit_code` is **your app's** exit code; `command_exit_code` is your `command`'s (`null` when no command ran or the 30 s limit killed it).
- `log_bytes` — size of the whole `/log/app.log` your command saw, so you know how much you did not read.
- `timed_out` / `truncated` — the command hit the 30 s limit (partial output is still returned), or its output was cut at ~256 KiB.

Only stdout/stderr is captured. An app that writes its logs to a file inside
the container has nothing here — log to stdout/stderr instead.

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — no runtime log available for this channel (or that `container_index`) yet
- `service_unavailable` (503) — the host cannot answer right now

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/images

Live built-image inventory for one channel (docker-template apps), newest first.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "tag": "xhost-app-...:abc1234",
      "sha": "abc1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345",
      "size_bytes": 412000000,
      "charged_size_bytes": 180000000,
      "matched_base": "node:22-slim",
      "created": 1752000000,
      "current": true
    }
  ],
  "image_cap_bytes": 536870912
}
```

- `charged_size_bytes` — the size counted against the plan cap (total minus warm-base layers); `matched_base` names the exempt warm base, or `null` if none matched.
- `current` — whether the image corresponds to the channel's currently deployed SHA.
- `image_cap_bytes` — the owner plan's charged-image-size cap.
- `images` is `null` (never an error) when the channel's host agent is unreachable, so callers can always render the rest.

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app or channel not found or not accessible

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/tree

List all files in the repo at the given ref. Lets a stateless agent see the current contents before editing.

**Required scope:** `repo:*`

**Query parameters:**

- `ref` (string, optional, default `master`) — Branch name or 40-char SHA.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "ref": "master",
  "sha": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2",
  "files": [
    {"path": "index.html", "kind": "blob", "size": 142},
    {"path": "static/style.css", "kind": "blob", "size": 87}
  ]
}
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app not found, or ref does not exist (e.g. empty repo with no commits yet)

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/blob

Return the raw bytes of a single file at the given ref. Useful when an agent needs to read existing content before modifying it.

**Required scope:** `repo:*`

**Query parameters:**

- `ref` (string, optional, default `master`) — Branch name or 40-char SHA.
- `path` (string, required) — Repository-relative file path.

**Response (200):** Raw file bytes (`application/octet-stream`).

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app, ref, or file not found

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/changeset

Apply a sparse changeset to the repo and create one real git commit on top of `ref`'s current HEAD (or as the initial commit on an empty branch). Designed for agents without shell access or local git. Three write fields mix freely in one commit: `changes` (whole content — string values upsert, `null` deletes), `edits` (`{path: [{old_string, new_string, replace_all}]}` — `old_string` must occur exactly once unless `replace_all`), and `patches` (`{path: hunk-text}` — headers are `@@` or `@@ anchor`, body lines begin with a space, `-`, or `+`, and there are no line numbers). Absent paths are unchanged, a path belongs to exactly one field, matching is byte-exact, and any failure fails the whole commit.

**Required scope:** `repo:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "ref": "master",
  "message": "agent: update headline",
  "changes": {
    "index.html": "<!doctype html><h1>hello</h1>",
    "old-page.html": null
  },
  "edits": {
    "static/style.css": [
      {"old_string": "  max-width: 40rem;", "new_string": "  max-width: 52rem;"}
    ]
  },
  "patches": {
    "src/version.ts": "@@ export const VERSION\n-export const VERSION = \"1.4\"\n+export const VERSION = \"1.5\"\n"
  }
}
```

- `ref` (string, optional, default `"master"`) — Target branch. Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9/_\-\.]*$`. Created if it does not yet exist.
- `message` (string, required) — Commit message. Must be non-empty.
- `changes` (object, optional) — Map of repo-relative path → string (upsert) or `null` (delete). Paths must be relative and must not contain `..` segments.
- `edits` (object, optional) — Map of path → a list of `{old_string, new_string, replace_all}`. `old_string` must be non-empty and must occur exactly once in the file unless `replace_all` is `true`. Edits apply in list order, each against the result of the previous one. The path must already exist on `ref`.
- `patches` (object, optional) — Map of path → hunk text. A hunk header is `@@`, or `@@ anchor` where the anchor is a line or unique substring copied from the file. Put the anchor on a line the hunk covers, or on the line just above it: matching starts there and runs to the end of the file. Body lines begin with a space (context), `-` (remove), or `+` (add). There are no line numbers and no line counts, and no trailing context line is required. Each hunk needs at least one context or `-` line. The path must already exist on `ref`.

Send at least one of `changes`, `edits`, or `patches`. A path belongs to exactly one of them. Matching for `edits` and `patches` is byte-exact — whitespace, indentation, and line endings all count. Any failure fails the whole commit and writes nothing.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "sha": "def456abcdef456abcdef456abcdef456abcdef4"
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint creates a commit but does not deploy. Pass the returned `sha` to `POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/deploy` to ship it. Same two-step model as `git push` followed by deploy.

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid path, invalid branch name, empty message, malformed changeset, a path in more than one field, or an edit or hunk whose anchor is absent or ambiguous (the message names the path and the count)
- `not_found` (404) — app not found

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/env

Set (upsert) an environment variable or secret on an app.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "key": "MY_VAR",
  "value": "my-value",
  "kind": "env",
  "channel_id": "uuid"
}
```

- `key` (string, required) — Must match `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$`. Reserved keys (system-injected) are rejected: `XHOST_USER`, `XHOST_SHA`, `XHOST_HTTP_PORT`, `PORT`, `XHOST_FORWARD_PORT`, `XHOST_READY_FILE`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_READONLY`, `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_REGION`.
- `value` (string, required) — The value to set (stored encrypted). Capped at 16 KiB of UTF-8, per value.
- `kind` (string, optional) — `env` (plain variable) or `secret`. Omitted, an existing key keeps its kind and a new key defaults to `env`. Secret values are omitted from list responses (metadata only); the single reveal path is `GET /apps/{app_id}/env/{key}/value` (the web console's reveal uses the same endpoint), and each reveal is audit-logged.
- `channel_id` (string, optional) — Omit for an app-level default; set to a channel id for a per-channel override. At deploy time the channel override wins over the app default, and system-injected keys win over both.

**Response:** 204 No Content

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid key format or reserved key
- `not_found` (404) — channel not found on this app

---

## DELETE /apps/{app_id}/env/{key}

Delete an environment variable from an app.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Query parameters:**
- `channel_id` (optional) — With it, deletes only that channel's override; without it, deletes the app-level default.

**Response:** 204 No Content

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/env

List an app's environment variables and secrets.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Query parameters:**
- `channel_id` (optional) — Without it, raw rows (app-level and per-channel). With it, the resolved view for that channel: app defaults merged with the channel's overrides, the override winning.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "env": [
    {
      "key": "MY_VAR",
      "kind": "env",
      "scope": "app",
      "channel_id": null,
      "updated_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
      "value": "my-value"
    },
    {
      "key": "API_TOKEN",
      "kind": "secret",
      "scope": "channel",
      "channel_id": "uuid",
      "updated_at": "2025-01-16T10:31:00Z",
      "value": null
    }
  ]
}
```

- `scope` — `app` (app-level default) or `channel` (channel override).
- `value` — Cleartext for `kind: "env"`; **always `null` for secrets** in list responses. The only read path for a secret's value is `GET /apps/{app_id}/env/{key}/value` (audit-logged); MCP has no reveal tool.

## GET /apps/{app_id}/env/{key}/value

Reveal one env value — the only read path for `kind: "secret"`. Every call records an `env.reveal` journal event (visible in `GET /apps/{app_id}/events`) before the value is returned. The web console's click-to-reveal uses this same endpoint.

**A protected action.** An agent credential gets `protected_action` (403) until the app owner turns agent access on. No MCP tool wraps this route.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Query parameters:**
- `channel_id` (optional) — With it, resolved semantics: that channel's override wins, falling back to the app-level row when the channel has no override. Without it, the app-level row only.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "key": "API_TOKEN",
  "kind": "secret",
  "scope": "channel",
  "value": "the-decrypted-value"
}
```

- `scope` — `app` or `channel`, the scope the value resolved from.

**Errors:**
- `protected_action` (403) — the app owner has agent access off; the message names the project settings URL
- `not_found` (404) — key not set at the requested scope, or value unavailable

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/deploys/{deploy_id}/env

Return the env snapshot recorded when a deploy started — what the app actually ran with.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "deploy_id": "uuid",
  "env": [
    {"key": "MY_VAR", "kind": "env", "source": "app", "value": "my-value"},
    {"key": "API_TOKEN", "kind": "secret", "source": "channel", "value": null}
  ],
  "system_keys": ["DATABASE_URL", "S3_BUCKET", "XHOST_SHA", "XHOST_USER"]
}
```

- `source` — `app` or `channel`, the scope the value resolved from.
- Secret values are masked (`null`); system-injected keys are listed by name only (their values are credentials and are not stored in the snapshot).

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — deploy not found, or it predates env snapshots

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/postgres/snapshots

List a channel's pre-deploy Postgres snapshots, newest first. A snapshot is taken automatically before every non-static deploy (unless the app's env sets `XHOST_DEPLOY_SKIP_DB_SNAPSHOT=1`). xhostd keeps the newest 1 on `basic` and the newest 3 on every paid plan, and it ages none of them out.

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json
[
  {
    "snapshot_id": "uuid",
    "deploy_id": "uuid",
    "kind": "pre_deploy",
    "git_sha": "abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01",
    "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
    "aligned_blob": true,
    "recoverable": true
  }
]
```

`deploy_id` is null on a `nightly` row, which no deploy triggers. `git_sha` is
null on a row from before that column. `recoverable` is true while a restore can
still reach the row, false once it cannot, and null while that is unknown.

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app/channel not found or channel Postgres not provisioned

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/postgres/restore

Roll the channel's database back to a prior snapshot. A failed restore loses nothing — the channel's data is left untouched. Each restore is audit-logged.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "confirm_db_name": "ch_<channel-uuid-hex>",
  "snapshot_id": "uuid"
}
```

- `confirm_db_name` (string, required) — Must exactly match the channel's `db_name` (from `GET .../postgres`); mismatches are rejected.
- `snapshot_id` (string, required) — A snapshot id from the snapshots list.

**Response (200):** The channel's updated Postgres status:
```json
{
  "db_name": "ch_...",
  "role_name": "r_...",
  "status": "ready",
  "last_error": null,
  "connection_count": 0,
  "connection_limit": 20,
  "password_set": true,
  "storage_bytes": 81920,
  "external_enabled": false,
  "external_host": "db.xhostd.com",
  "external_database": "my-app"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — `invalid_confirmation` (`db_name` mismatch)
- `permission_denied` (403) — `prod_restore_blocked`: restoring the `prod` channel requires the app env `XHOST_ALLOW_PROD_RESTORE=1`
- `not_found` (404) — snapshot not found, or its file is missing
- `conflict` (409) — `channel_busy` (a deploy is queued/running), or the account is mid-move
- `service_unavailable` (503) — `postgres_unavailable`

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/blob/credentials

Return the S3-compatible credentials for the channel's object store — the only payload carrying the decrypted secret. Each read is audit-logged. Note this is a POST with no body.

**Required scope:** `blob:*`

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "access_key_id": "...",
  "secret_access_key": "...",
  "endpoint": "https://my-site-alice.s3.xhostd.app",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "bucket": "my-app-alice-xhostd-com"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app/channel not found or channel blob not provisioned
- `conflict` (409) — `blob_not_ready`
- `service_unavailable` (503) — `blob_unavailable`

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/blob

Return the channel's object-store status and usage.

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "last_error": null,
  "usage_bytes": 1048576,
  "external_enabled": false,
  "virtual_bucket": "my-app-alice-xhostd-com",
  "virtual_endpoint": "https://my-site-alice.s3.xhostd.app",
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app/channel not found or channel blob not provisioned
- `service_unavailable` (503) — `blob_unavailable`

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/domains

Attach a custom domain to a channel (max 5 per channel; domains are globally unique across xhostd). Idempotent for the same channel — re-POSTing the same domain returns the existing row with its token preserved. Returns the DNS records the user must create at their registrar.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "domain": "myapp.com"
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "domain": "myapp.com",
  "status": "pending",
  "reason": null,
  "dns_records": {
    "txt_host": "_xhost.myapp.com",
    "txt_value": "xhost-verify-...",
    "cname_target": "my-app-alice.xhostd.app",
    "a_values": ["198.51.100.7"]
  },
  "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
  "verified_at": null
}
```

- `dns_records` — Create the TXT record with `txt_value`, plus a routing record: `CNAME` → `cname_target` for subdomains, or `A` → `a_values` at an apex. `a_values` may be empty if platform IP resolution transiently failed.

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — `invalid domain: <reason>` (`is_ip_address`, `invalid_idna`, `too_long`, `invalid_label`, `platform_domain_forbidden`, `needs_dot`) or `domain_limit_reached`
- `conflict` (409) — `domain_taken` (another channel owns this domain)

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/domains/{domain}/verify

Re-run the TXT + routing DNS check for an attached domain and update its status. Idempotent and retryable — DNS propagation takes minutes, so a `pending` status with a transient reason is normal at first.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Response (200):** Same shape as the attach response, with updated `status`, `reason`, and `verified_at`. `status` flips `pending → verified` on a passing check. `reason` uses a closed vocabulary: `txt_nxdomain`, `txt_token_mismatch`, `dns_not_pointing`, `domain_nxdomain` (the four definitive failures — the only ones that downgrade a verified domain), plus the transient `txt_lookup_failed`, `dns_lookup_failed`, `platform_ip_unknown`.

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app/channel/domain not found

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/domains

List every custom domain attached to a channel.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "domains": [ ... ]
}
```

Each item has the same shape as the attach response.

---

## DELETE /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/domains/{domain}

Detach a custom domain. Removes the routing and stops certificate renewals; the existing cert expires on its own.

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "ok": true
}
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app/channel/domain not found

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/forward

Give a channel a public `host:port` that carries raw TCP into its container. Idempotent per channel: a channel that already has an endpoint comes back **200** with the same `host`/`port` and its `allow_cidrs` replaced by the submitted list; a fresh allocation is **201**. The address is stable for the life of the exposure, so it is safe to hand out.

Inside the container the process must listen on `0.0.0.0` at the port in `$XHOST_FORWARD_PORT` (a fixed platform-wide port injected into every non-`static` container). xhostd pumps the bytes through unmodified — no TLS is added and nothing is authenticated. Requires the app's **admin** role: a member gets `not_found`, never `permission_denied`, so a member cannot tell "this channel has no endpoint" from "I may not manage it". No redeploy is needed either way.

**Required scope:** `channel:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "allow_cidrs": ["203.0.113.0/24"]
}
```

- `allow_cidrs` (array of strings, optional, default `[]`) — Source-address allowlist: IPv4/IPv6 networks or bare addresses (`203.0.113.7` is accepted and normalized to `203.0.113.7/32`), at most 16 entries. **Empty or omitted means the whole internet may connect.**

**Response (201 on a fresh allocation, 200 when the channel was already exposed):**
```json
{
  "channel_id": "uuid",
  "channel": "prod",
  "host": "fwd-1.xhostd.app",
  "port": 27431,
  "allow_cidrs": ["203.0.113.0/24"],
  "active": true,
  "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

- `active` — Whether the endpoint is actually carrying traffic. The row existing is not enough: `false` means the project's port-forwarding toggle is off or the owner's plan no longer includes port forwarding.

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — more than 16 `allow_cidrs`, an entry that is not a valid IP address or range, or a `static` app (it runs no process that could accept a connection; use `app` or `docker`)
- `plan_limit_exceeded` (402) — the owner's plan does not include public TCP endpoints; the message carries the upgrade URL
- `permission_denied` (403) — the project's port-forwarding toggle is off. The toggle itself (`POST /apps/{app_id}/forwarding`) is a protected action — there is no MCP tool for it, it answers `protected_action` to an agent credential, and the message here names the URL a project admin must use
- `not_found` (404) — app/channel not found, or the caller is below the admin role
- `conflict` (409) — no forward node has a free port right now

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/forwards

List every exposed channel of the app, in channel-name order. App-scoped on purpose: one round trip covers the whole project, and there is no per-channel variant. Readable by any member.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "forwards": [ ... ]
}
```

Each item has the same shape as the expose response.

---

## DELETE /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/forward

Release the channel's public endpoint. New connections are refused immediately and the address returns to the pool, so anything that reconnects breaks and re-exposing later allocates a **new** address. Connections already established keep running until they close on their own — this does not cut off a session in progress. To drop those as well, `POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/deploy` for the same channel **after** the release: cutover replaces the container, ending every session into the old one. The container otherwise keeps running and keeps serving its HTTPS URL. Requires the app's **admin** role (a member gets `not_found`).

**Required scope:** `channel:*`

**Response:** 204 No Content

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app/channel not found, the channel has no endpoint, or the caller is below the admin role

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/github/sync

For apps connected to a GitHub source: fetch the latest GitHub commits into the app's internal xhostd mirror without deploying. Deploys auto-sync anyway; use this to refresh the mirror or surface sync errors on their own. Requires the admin role (or higher) on the app. Not a protected action — it pulls the remote the owner already chose, so it never answers `protected_action`. Connecting and disconnecting a GitHub repo ARE protected actions, and neither has an MCP tool.

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "remote_url": "git@github.com:alice/my-app.git",
  "public_key": "ssh-ed25519 ...",
  "connected_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
  "last_synced_at": "2025-01-16T10:35:00Z",
  "last_sync_status": "ok",
  "last_sync_error": null,
  "last_sync_refs": {"master": "abc1234..."}
}
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app not found, or no GitHub mirror connected

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/events

List the app's activity events (attributed audit trail of project mutations: member changes, deploys, env writes and reveals, database operations, git pushes/commits), newest first. No secret values appear.

**Query parameters:**
- `limit` (integer, optional, default 50) — Max events to return, clamped to 1–100.
- `before` (timestamp, optional) — Return only events created before this instant (pagination cursor).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "actor_username": "alice",
      "action": "deploy.create",
      "target": "prod",
      "detail": {},
      "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "next_before": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

- `next_before` — Pass as `before` to fetch the next page; `null` when there are no more events.

---

## POST /exports

Queue a downloadable export (takeout) of a channel's or app's data: deployed code, a Postgres dump of the channel's database, and (when small enough) the channel's object-storage files. Env variable keys are included as blank placeholders — secret values are never exported. One non-terminal export per user at a time.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "scope": "channel",
  "app_id": "uuid",
  "channel_id": "uuid"
}
```

- `scope` (string, required) — `channel` (one channel) or `app` (every channel).
- `app_id` (string, required) — The app to export.
- `channel_id` (string, required for `scope: "channel"`) — Ignored for `scope: "app"`.

**Response (202):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "scope": "channel",
  "app_id": "uuid",
  "channel_id": "uuid",
  "status": "queued",
  "detail": null,
  "progress_pct": 0,
  "size_bytes": null,
  "error": null,
  "blobs_included": false,
  "blobs_reason": null,
  "blob_object_count": null,
  "blob_bytes_estimate": null,
  "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
  "finished_at": null,
  "expires_at": null
}
```

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid scope, missing `channel_id`, or nothing deployed to export
- `conflict` (409) — an export is already in progress, or the account is mid-move

---

## GET /exports

List the authenticated user's exports, newest first.

**Response (200):** A JSON array of export objects, same shape as the `POST /exports` response.

---

## GET /exports/{export_id}

Poll an export's progress. Statuses: `queued`, `running`, `ready`, `failed`.

**Response (200):** Same shape as the `POST /exports` response, with `progress_pct`, `size_bytes`, `error`, `blobs_included`/`blobs_reason`, and `expires_at` filled in as the build advances.

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — export not found or not owned by caller

---

## POST /exports/{export_id}/download-token

Mint a short-lived `exports:read` token for a ready, owned export. A unified credential already reaches the download routes, because `exports:read` is default-granted; use this route when you want a single-purpose token instead — for example one you paste into a `curl` command, where a full credential would expose your git and Postgres passwords.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "token": "xh_...",
  "download_url": "/exports/{export_id}/download",
  "blobs_download_url": "/exports/{export_id}/download/blobs",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z",
  "blobs_included": true,
  "blobs_reason": null
}
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — export not found, not owned by caller, or not ready

---

## POST /credentials

Mint a unified credential for the authenticated user. The returned token serves as your git password, Postgres password, and platform API bearer, and carries the full default scope set (`repo:*`, `deploy:*`, `channel:*`, `db:*`, `blob:*`, `stats:read`, `exports:read`, `snapshots:read`, `blobs:read`). It lives 30 days unless you ask for less.

**Request body (optional):**
```json
{
  "scopes": ["repo:*", "db:*"],
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```
`scopes`, when supplied, must be a non-empty subset of the default set and mints a least-privilege credential. `expires_in` is a lifetime in seconds, at most `2592000` (30 days); omit it for 30 days. The two compose, so a credential for one job can be both least-privilege and short-lived — `{"scopes": ["repo:*"], "expires_in": 3600}` is an hour of git access and nothing else. Prefer that over a full-scope credential whenever you know the job.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "token": "xh_...",
  "username": "alice",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
  "scopes": ["repo:*", "deploy:*", "channel:*", "db:*", "blob:*", "stats:read", "exports:read", "snapshots:read", "blobs:read"]
}
```

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — `scopes` empty, unknown, or outside the default set; `expires_in` not positive or above the ceiling

**SSH is the first git transport wherever a shell is available, and it needs no token** — see `POST /ssh-keys` below. This token stays required for the HTTPS push, for Postgres and for the platform API.

To push over HTTPS: set the remote with the token in the **password** field — `https://<username>:<token>@git.xhostd.com/<username>/<app>.git` (the per-app `repo_url` from `GET /apps/{app_id}` already has the right path), then `git push`. Any username works; the password is what git.xhostd.com checks. (git.xhostd.com also accepts the token via `Authorization: Bearer` — e.g. `git config http.extraHeader "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` — but native `git` uses the Basic-password path above.) The token is valid for 30 days; re-mint after expiry.

---

## POST /ssh-keys

Register one OpenSSH public key on the authenticated user's account, for git over SSH. A key belongs to the account, not to one app. Send the PUBLIC half only — the content of a `.pub` file; the platform stores no private key.

**SSH is the first git transport wherever a shell is available.** The private half never enters a tool call, and one registration covers every app on the machine. Reuse `~/.ssh/xhost_ed25519` if it exists; otherwise make the keypair at exactly that path — never in the project directory, and never with a per-project, per-app or per-tool suffix, which would only mint a second key on the account. HTTPS with the token in the remote URL is the fallback: take it where the network blocks outbound port 22, or after an SSH push fails.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "public_key": "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... agent@box",
  "label": "claude-code"
}
```

- `public_key` (string, required) — one OpenSSH public-key line.
- `label` (string, optional) — your own name for the key; max 64 characters.

Unknown fields are refused: this route answers **422** for a body that holds a field it does not declare (e.g. `name` in place of `label`).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "label": "claude-code",
  "algo": "ssh-ed25519",
  "fingerprint": "SHA256:abc...",
  "created_at": "2026-08-17T10:30:00Z",
  "last_used_at": null
}
```

Then push: `git remote add xhost-ssh "git@git.xhostd.com:<username>/<app>.git"` and `GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/.ssh/xhost_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes" git push xhost-ssh HEAD:master`, where `-o IdentitiesOnly=yes` stops ssh from offering another key it finds first. The platform also notifies the user about the new key, with its label and fingerprint.

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — the line is no valid OpenSSH public key, or the label is longer than 64 characters
- `conflict` (409) — the platform holds that fingerprint already; a fingerprint is unique platform-wide. For the key at `~/.ssh/xhost_ed25519` this only means an earlier session registered it, so the key works — push with it. Never mint a second keypair to clear a 409.

---

## GET /ssh-keys

List the authenticated user's SSH keys, newest first. Metadata only — no route returns a key.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "ssh_keys": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "label": "claude-code",
      "algo": "ssh-ed25519",
      "fingerprint": "SHA256:abc...",
      "created_at": "2026-08-17T10:30:00Z",
      "last_used_at": null
    }
  ]
}
```

`last_used_at` is null while the key served no git command yet.

---

## DELETE /ssh-keys/{key_id}

Delete one SSH key the caller owns. The delete is the whole revoke, so a push with that key fails at once.

**Response:** `204 No Content`

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — no such key, or the key belongs to another account

---

## POST /feedback

Submit free-text feedback to the xhostd team about platform friction (many iterations, an unclear tool/error, a missing capability). Attributed to the authenticated user. Fire-and-forget.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "message": "Deploy logs don't stream — had to poll get_deploy_log repeatedly.",
  "app_id": "uuid"
}
```

- `message` (string, required) — The feedback text. Must be non-empty after trimming; max 4000 characters.
- `app_id` (string, optional) — Id of the app being worked on, for context. An unknown or inaccessible id is silently dropped (stored as null); the feedback still lands.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "status": "Received"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — empty message, message longer than 4000 characters, or the account reached its report limit (1000 by default; an operator raises or lowers it per account, and the message names the limit that applies)

---

## GET /feedback

List the authenticated user's feedback reports, newest first, each with the xhostd team's answers. One call answers one page of the account's reports, whichever surface filed them.

**Query parameters:**
- `limit` (integer, optional) — how many reports to return, 1–200. Default 50.
- `cursor` (string, optional) — the `next_cursor` of the previous call (pagination cursor). Omit it on the first call. A cursor the route cannot read answers `bad_request` (400).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "reports": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "message": "Deploy logs don't stream.",
      "status": "Resolved",
      "source": "agent",
      "app_name": "myapp",
      "created_at": "2026-01-04T10:00:00+00:00",
      "handled_at": "2026-01-05T09:30:00+00:00",
      "messages": [
        {
          "body": "Status changed to Resolved.\n\nStreaming logs shipped today.",
          "created_at": "2026-01-05T09:30:00+00:00",
          "status": "Resolved"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": "MjAyNi0wMS0wNFQxMDowMDowMCswMDowMHwzZjFhN2MyZS05YjY0LTRkMWEtOGU1Ny0yYzBiOWQ0ZjZhMTM"
}
```

- `status` — one of `Received` (not acted on yet), `Resolved` (the team did the work), `Closed` (the team will not act on it).
- `source` — `agent` or `console`, the surface the report came from.
- `app_name` — null when the report carries no app context.
- `messages` — the team's answers, oldest first. A message carries a `status` only when it records a status change. Internal team notes are never listed.
- `next_cursor` — an opaque value. Pass it as `cursor` to read the next page; `null` when the account has no older report. Build no cursor of your own.

---

## GET /api/user/stats

Return dashboard stats for the authenticated user. No admin privileges required.

The counts and the `sites` rows cover every project the caller can see: the projects the caller owns, plus every project shared with the caller. A `repo` value reads `owner/project`, so a shared row names its owner. The `resources` block is the caller's OWN memory and CPU alone, because a shared project runs under its owner's resource slice.

**Required scope:** `stats:read`

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "user_id": "uuid-string",
  "platform": {
    "apps": 3,
    "channels": 5,
    "running_channels": 4,
    "deploys_last_hour": 1,
    "deploys_last_day": 7,
    "success_last_day": 6,

    }
  ],
  "collected_at": "2025-01-15 10:30:00 UTC"
}
```

**Notes:**
- Returns only the calling user's own apps, channels, deploys, and resource usage.
- Resource usage (`resources`) reflects the user's systemd cgroup slice (memory and CPU budgets). Values are zero if cgroup limits are not configured.

## GET /me/usage

Return the account's total database storage against its SOFT plan cap, plus current-month egress.

The storage cap warns and blocks nothing: no write fails and no deploy fails. Egress has no cap and the payload carries no egress limit field, because no plan states an egress figure: xhostd measures the month's bytes, reports them, counts them against nothing, and charges nothing for them.

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "plan": "basic",
  "storage_bytes": 1572864,
  "storage_limit_mb": 250,
  "bandwidth_month_bytes": 104857600
}
```

**Errors:**
- `503 postgres_unavailable` — the account's database server is unreachable, or a database could not be measured. xhostd never reports a partial total.

---

## GET /plans

Return every plan tier and the caps it grants, lowest rank first. This is the one published source of a cap number: read it instead of hardcoding a limit.

The route takes **no token**, reads no database, and answers every caller the same body. It carries no price — billing lives at Lemon Squeezy.

**Request body:** None

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "plans": [
    {
      "tier": "basic",
      "rank": 0,
      "max_channels": 5,
      "cpu_soft_cores": 0.1,
      "cpu_burst": 2,
      "visible_cores": 1,
      "mem_limit_mb": 128,
      "storage_mb": 250,
      "blob_storage_bytes": 1073741824,
      "image_size_bytes": 536870912,
      "snapshot_retention_days": 1,
      "deploy_snapshot_keep": 1,
      "port_forwarding": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes:**
- `storage_mb` is the account-wide database cap and is SOFT: over-limit warns and blocks nothing.
- No row states an egress figure, because no plan limits egress. xhostd measures your egress and reports it on `GET /me/usage`; nothing counts it against a number and no egress carries a charge.
- `blob_storage_bytes` is the account-wide object-storage cap and is ENFORCED: the S3 gateway rejects a crossing `PUT` with `507`. `-1` means unlimited.
- `snapshot_retention_days` ages out `nightly` snapshots; `deploy_snapshot_keep` counts the `pre_deploy` snapshots a channel keeps, and a `pre_deploy` snapshot never ages out.
- The MCP tool `get_account_overview` composes this route with `/me/stats`, `/me/usage/resources`, `/apps`, `/me/usage` and `/me/blob/storage`, and returns the caps beside the account's current usage in its `plan_headroom` block.

## Hostname Rules

All user-facing names (app names, usernames, channel names) must be valid **DNS labels**:

- Lowercase letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`)
- 1 to 40 characters
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen
- Regex: `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$`

**Reserved app name prefixes** (blocked as exact match or `<prefix>-*`):
`git`, `api`, `www`, `admin`, `preview`, `staging`

**Reserved channel names** (cannot be user-created):
`prod`

**Hostname derivation:**
- Production channel: `<app>-<username>.<domain>` (e.g., `myapp-alice.xhostd.app`)
- Other channels: `<channel>-<app>-<username>.<domain>` (e.g., `wildcard-myapp-alice.xhostd.app`)
- Fan-out preview channels: `preview-<branch-slug>-<app>-<username>.<domain>`

---

## Channel Status Values

- `provisioning` — Channel has been created but no deploy has completed yet
- `running` — A deploy has completed successfully and the channel is serving traffic

---

## Deploy Status Values

- `queued` — Deploy is waiting to be picked up by the worker
- `running` — Deploy is currently building/deploying
- `success` — Deploy completed successfully
- `failed` — Deploy failed (check logs for details)

---

## git_ref_binding Format

Must match the pattern `branch:<name>` or `branch:*`.

- `branch:master` — Triggers on pushes to the `master` branch
- `branch:staging` — Triggers on pushes to the `staging` branch
- `branch:*` — Wildcard; deploying a branch that matches the wildcard creates a child channel named `preview-<slug>` bound to `branch:<actual-branch-name>`.

The `<name>` portion (when not `*`) must match: `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9/_\-\.]*$`

## Error Codes

| Code | HTTP Status | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `auth_required` | 401 | No Authorization header or invalid format |
| `token_invalid` | 401 | Token does not exist or is malformed |
| `token_revoked` | 401 | Token has been revoked |
| `scope_denied` | 403 | Token lacks the required scope |
| `permission_denied` | 403 | Action not allowed for this caller or project (admin privileges required, or a project switch such as port forwarding is off) |
| `protected_action` | 403 | A protected action needs a person in the web console. Tell the user to open the URL in the message. Tell the user to turn **agent access** on. Retry the call after the user answers. Ownership transfer is the exception: only a console session transfers a project, and no setting opens it to a credential |
| `admin_not_configured` | 403 | Server admin user not set up |
| `not_found` | 404 | Resource does not exist or is not owned by caller |
| `bad_request` | 400 | Validation failure (see message for details) |
| `conflict` | 409 | State conflict (e.g. `domain_taken`, `channel_busy`, export already running) |
| *(no code)* | 422 | A body that fails validation — a missing field on any route, or an unknown field on `POST /ssh-keys`, the one route that refuses one. This answer carries FastAPI's `{"detail": [...]}` shape, not the `{"error": {...}}` envelope, so an MCP client shows it as a pydantic report. Read the field name in `detail`, correct it, and call again. Do not retry the same body: it fails again |
| `bad_gateway` | 502 | Upstream service error |
| `service_unavailable` | 503 | Dependent service degraded (e.g. `postgres_unavailable`, `blob_unavailable`) |
| `internal_error` | 500 | Unexpected server error |

### Protected actions

Twelve routes need a person in the web console. They are the three member
writes, the two invite answers, and ownership transfer. The list also holds
the two external-access toggles and the port-forwarding project toggle. The
list ends with the GitHub connect, the GitHub disconnect, and
`GET /apps/{app_id}/env/{key}/value`. Reads stay open:
`GET /apps/{app_id}/members`, `GET /invites`, `GET /apps/{app_id}/github`,
`GET /apps/{app_id}/env` and `POST /apps/{app_id}/github/sync` never answer
this error.

An agent credential gets `protected_action` on all twelve routes. The **agent
access** switch opens eleven of them. The switch never opens ownership
transfer, so that route fails again after the user turns the switch on.

Which switch applies depends on the route. The nine project actions read the
app owner's switch on the project settings page. The two invite answers read
the caller's own account default on the account page. The message names the
correct page, so quote it to the user. Do not retry the call before the user
answers.

The app field `agent_protected_actions_effective` predicts this error: when it
is `false`, an agent credential gets `protected_action` on those nine project
actions. `agent_protected_actions_enabled` is the raw override, and `null`
there means the app inherits the account default of the owner. The field does
not predict the two invite answers or ownership transfer. The caller's own
account default opens the invite answers, and no setting opens the transfer.

Ownership transfer is the one action no setting opens. Tell the user to sign
in to the console. The user transfers the project there.

## Token Scopes

OAuth-issued bearer tokens (used by the MCP server) carry the full default scope set: `repo:*`, `deploy:*`, `channel:*`, `db:*`, `blob:*`, `stats:read`, `exports:read`, `snapshots:read`, `blobs:read`.

Unified credentials minted via `POST /credentials` carry the full default scope set (`repo:*`, `deploy:*`, `channel:*`, `db:*`, `blob:*`, `stats:read`, `exports:read`, `snapshots:read`, `blobs:read`) unless a narrower `scopes` subset is requested, and live 30 days unless a shorter `expires_in` is requested.

| Scope | Grants |
|-------|--------|
| `repo:*` | Create apps (POST /apps), push to git repos |
| `channel:*` | Create channels (POST /apps/{id}/channels) |
| `deploy:*` | Deploy (POST /apps/{id}/channels/{id}/deploy), manage env vars |
| `db:*` | Connect to Postgres through the database gateway (external DB access) |
| `blob:*` | Mint object-storage credentials for a channel |
| `stats:read` | Read public account, resource, app, channel, health, and admin statistics |
| `exports:read` | Download a ready export archive |
| `snapshots:read` | Download a Postgres snapshot extract |
| `blobs:read` | Download an object-storage snapshot tarball |
